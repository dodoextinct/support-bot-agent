## What happens if I don't pay back OR miss EMI repayments on the Loan?

If you miss or fail to repay your EMIs on the loan, it can negatively affect your credit score and may lead to additional charges or legal action. We strongly urge you to avoid missing your loan monthly installment payments.

## How can I pay my missed EMI or foreclose the loan?

If your EMI is not cleared from your bank account via the auto debit E-NACH mandate on the due date due to inadvertent circumstances, you can pay it yourself through the Angel One app. Follow these steps:
Open the Angel One app.
Navigate to the loan pass book.
Use the “Pay Now” section to make the payment via net banking or debit card.
Alternatively, the EMI mandate will be represented for auto debit from your bank account.
To foreclose the loan, you can also use the Angel One app to find the option to foreclose and complete the payment using the same methods.

## How can I change my bank account used for repaying the EMI?

Presently, we do not have the feature to facilitate the change of the bank account used to set up the EMI mandate. We urge you to continue servicing your EMI through the bank account that was used at the time of loan disbursement.

## When can I foreclose my loan?

Your eligibility for foreclosure varies depending on the lender partner. Please check your loan documents for specific details regarding foreclosure eligibility and conditions.
