## How to check the required margin for placing the Basket Order?

The required margin and the available margin will be shown upfront in the Basket. To give you the margin benefit, the required margin for the entire basket will be calculated using the SPAN calculator.

---

## What if the available margin is less than the required margin?

You can add the funds with the ‘Add Funds’ feature within the Basket to match the required margin.

---

## What will happen to my basket after execution?

After placing the Basket Order, the status of individual orders will be shown inside the basket. You can take decisions at the individual order level like modifying a pending order or retrying a failed order.

---

## Can I see my placed Basket Order the next day?

If you have saved your basket, then you can see it the next day, but the orders will be reset to the initial state i.e., before placing the Basket Order. However, you won’t be able to see the status of the orders. Please know that if you don’t manually save the basket, it will not appear in the Baskets Tab.

---

## What is the margin benefit in the Basket?

When you place individual orders, you do not get a hedging benefit and have to pay the entire required margin upfront. But when you hedge your position in the basket (i.e. combine 2 or more orders), you get the benefit of hedging in terms of lower required margin.

---

## Can the basket save time in order execution?

You can save time using Basket Order as multiple orders are placed in one click. So, there is no need to place and execute individual orders.
