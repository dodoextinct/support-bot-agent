## I have not received Dividend for the shares that I am holding in my demat account. What should I do?

If you hold your shares in your Demat account on record date then the dividend will be credited to your bank account. However, if those shares are in Pool account, then the dividend will be credited to your Angel One ledger.
The dividend is generally paid 30-45 days after the record date.
In case you do not receive the same post 90 days from the Record date you can check the status with the Registrar (RTA).
