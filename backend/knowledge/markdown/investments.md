## My latest investment is not showing up in investments?

Your Investments will appear in your ‘Investments’ Tab when your orders moves to ‘Completed’ section of your Orders Tab.
This happens when we get the confirmation of Unit allotment by respective AMCs. This process generally takes 3/4 working days from order placement date.
Your portfolio updation date in Order timeline is our estimate of when Unit allotment confirmation from AMC will come through.
Please do not worry, This date date does not have any relation to your NAV date. Your NAV date depend on realization of funds by AMC.

## My Current value is not updated?

our Current Value for mutual fund portfolio are calculated based by latest NAVs of funds held by you.
Mutual fund NAVs (Net Asset Value) are updated every day after the market closes from Monday to Friday (All working days)
This means that the Current value you see on a particular day reflects the exact current value as per previous working day.
For example, on June 3rd, you will see the Current Value for June 2nd. The Current Value for June 3rd will be updated later on June 3rd, after the market closes. Therefore, throughout June 3rd, you will view the Current value from June 2nd. On June 4th, you will see Current Value of June 3rd.
As Saturdays and Sundays are considered holidays (along with other market holidays), there are no updates to the Current values on these days as NAV does not change.
However, certain special mutual funds (such as FoF) have their NAV updated once a week. So they current value might change if you hold these funds.
