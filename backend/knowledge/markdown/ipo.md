## How can I get a guaranteed IPO allotment?

We would like to explain that Angel One is merely a platform to apply for IPO and has no control over its allotment. IPO allotment can never be guaranteed since, in case of over-subscription, the allotment is done via a lottery system. However, you can avoid application rejection by
Applying from only 1 Demat account per PAN
Applying at cut-off price
Ensuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN
For example: Jack is using Jill’s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack’s application will be rejected because
Jill’s bank A/C used is not linked to the Demat A/c of Jack
Jill’s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack’s PAN

---

## Where can I check my refund status in case of a rejected/non-allotted IPO application?

Banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO.

## Why didn’t I get my IPO allotment?
