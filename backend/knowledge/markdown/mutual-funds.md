## What will be the NAV for my order?

Applicable NAV is based on realization of fund by respective AMC house and subject to successful order processing by BSE star before cut-offs. Here ‘realization of funds’ means that NAV applicable for your order will depend on if the fund house has receievd money or not
Please find the cut-off timings for various types of funds and orders
Furthermore,
NAV applicability for orders placed on Saturday, Sundays and other market/public holidays depends on when orders are placed on exchange. Here it is
the
next business day.
Payments made via UPI mode generally result in
same-day
NAV if the order is placed before cut-off.
This happens because settlement to ICCL happens generally happens before cut-off if made via UPI.
Angel One depends on payment aggregator for ICCL settlements.
Payments made via Netbanking generally result in next working day’s NAV. This happens as settlement to ICCL does not happen real time and generally takes places on ‘T+1’ basis. Angel One depends on payment aggregator for ICCL settlements. So even if order and payment is successful before cut-off, If the payment mode is netbanking, This might result in next day’s NAV.
In Summary, In some cases, Even if order and payment happens before cut-off, NAV will depend
on settlement to ICCL and realization of funds by AMC
