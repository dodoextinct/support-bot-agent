# Options

## How come I need to purchase the contracts after the stock options expire?

If your stock options contract expire in ITM (Profit), you will have to purchase your contracts. As a result, if you are not interested in purchasing the contracts and only interested in trading them, it is recommended that you sell them before they expire.
