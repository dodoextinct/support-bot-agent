# Rejected Loans

## Why was my loan application rejected even though I have a decent salary?

Your loan application is evaluated based on multiple factors. While your salary is one aspect, other considerations include your credit score, existing debt, and our lender partners’ policies.

## Why was my loan application rejected?

Your application did not meet the requirements of our lender partners’ policies. Therefore, we are unable to offer you a loan at this time.
