# Stock Pledging Charges

## What are the charges for pledging and unpledging shares?

A fixed transaction fee of ₹20 + GST is charged for each pledge and unpledge request, regardless of the number of shares. The split is as follows.
INR 5 (Depository) + INR 15 (Angel One Charge) + GST
For example,
Suppose you want to pledge 100 shares of ABC Ltd. and 50 shares of XYZ Ltd. You will be charged ₹40 + GST for 2 requests, irrespective of the number of shares in each request.
Similarly, if you want to place one unpledge request for 100 shares of ABC Ltd. and two unpledge requests for 50 shares and 20 shares of XYZ Ltd, respectively. In this case, you will be charged (₹20 x 3) = ₹60 + GST for 3 requests, irrespective of the number of shares in each request.
