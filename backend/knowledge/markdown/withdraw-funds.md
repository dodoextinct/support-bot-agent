## Why is my withdrawal amount not credited to my bank on time?

The delay in crediting your withdrawal amount can be due to the following reasons:
Bank Delay:
Angel One has approved your request, but there’s a delay at the bank’s end. Please wait for 4 hours or directly contact your bank in this case.
New Trades:
If you entered into new trades after placing the withdrawal request, it can delay the settlement and processing. Please wait for 24 hours for processing and approval.
Non-Trading Days:
Withdrawal requests are processed only on trading/working days. For example, if you placed a request at 6 pm on Thursday, and Friday and the next Monday are holidays, your funds will be credited by 11:30 am on Tuesday. Consider weekends and trading/settlement holidays when planning your withdrawal.
High Volume of Requests:
In rare cases, a high number of requests can delay processing from Angel One. Please wait for 6 hours from the cut-off time and reach out for support.

## Why is my money not credited to my bank account even though the withdrawal request is approved?

## Why is my withdrawal amount not credited instantly?

Withdrawal requests are not credited instantly because they are processed in batches to account for any trades you might have entered on that day. These requests are processed after trading hours, considering your buy/sell transactions.

## Why is my withdrawal request partially approved?

Your withdrawal request might be partially approved due to the following reasons:
New Trades:

Margin Requirements:
You have margin requirements in your account.
