# Withdrawable Balance

## Why is my withdrawable balance less than the trading balance?

Your withdrawable balance is the amount eligible for withdrawal on a given day. Any unsettled balance from your trades will be available for withdrawal on T+1 day (next working day).
The following balances will be available for withdrawal on the next working day:
Funds from delivery sell transactions.
Profits from intraday transactions.
Profits from F&O transactions.
Funds from commodity and currency transactions.

## Why is my withdrawable balance not updated?

Your withdrawable balance is updated once every morning, after adjusting for all the transactions made on the previous trading day. This balance can be different from the trading balance, which changes in real time.
